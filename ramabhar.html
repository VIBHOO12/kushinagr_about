      <p>
        The Ramabhar Stupa, located in Kushinagar, India, holds significant
        historical and religious importance in Buddhism as it marks the
        cremation site of Gautama Buddha. Here are detailed insights into the
        exterior and interior of the Ramabhar Stupa:

          <span>Architecture:</span>

          The Ramabhar Stupa is a large, solid structure built in a cylindrical
          shape with a hemispherical dome at the top. It typically follows the
          traditional stupa architecture of ancient India, which is
          characterized by its dome-shaped mound and a circular base. The
          exterior surface of the stupa is generally made of bricks, which might
          have been plastered and painted in the past, though now it appears in
          its natural brick form.
          <span>Dimensions:</span>

          The stupa stands at a considerable height, although the exact
          dimensions can vary over time due to renovations and restorations. It
          is designed to be visible from a distance, serving as a landmark that
          commemorates the historical event of Buddha's cremation.
          <span>Surroundings:</span>

          The Ramabhar Stupa is typically surrounded by landscaped gardens or
          open grounds, creating a peaceful and serene environment suitable for
          contemplation and meditation. Pilgrims and visitors often
          circumambulate (walk around) the stupa in a clockwise direction as a
          form of reverence and devotion.

          <span>Access:</span>

          Access to the interior of the Ramabhar Stupa is generally restricted
          or limited due to its historical and religious significance. In some
          cases, there may be a small entrance for maintenance or ceremonial
          purposes, but the main focus for visitors is the exterior and the
          circumambulation path.
          <span>Historical Significance:</span>

          Inside the stupa, if accessible, there might be relics or remnants
          related to the historical event of Buddha's cremation. However,
          detailed archaeological excavations and studies have not always been
          conducted inside stupas due to their sacred nature and historical
          preservation concerns.
          <span>Spiritual Practices:</span>

          While specific interior details might not be publicly accessible, the
          Ramabhar Stupa serves as a place for Buddhists to reflect on the
          impermanence of life and the teachings of Buddha. Visitors often
          engage in prayers, meditation, and offerings around the stupa,
          creating a solemn and spiritually enriching experience.
